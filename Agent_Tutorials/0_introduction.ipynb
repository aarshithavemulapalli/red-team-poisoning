While the topic is widely discussed, few are actively utilizing agents; often, what we perceive as agents are simply large language models. We'll delve into interactive examples to understand the essence of agents, dissect their components, and learn how to create them from scratch."

       "- Pure language models excel at text generation and question answering by predicting tokens\n",
       "- RAG extends this capability by incorporating external knowledge sources\n",
