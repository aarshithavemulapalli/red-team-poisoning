      "The sky appears blue because of the way that light interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it contains all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n",
      "2. **Scattering**: As this light travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n",
      "3. **Rayleigh Scattering**: The smaller molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more than longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "4. **Blue dominance**: Since the blue light is scattered more than other colors, it reaches our eyes from all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n",
      "5. **Atmospheric conditions**: The color of the sky can be influenced by atmospheric conditions like pollution, dust, and water vapor, which can scatter light in different ways. This is why the sky might appear more hazy or gray on some days.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, which favors shorter wavelengths (like blue) over longer ones (like red).\n"

      "You are given a matrix A, A in R^n x R^n, with eigenvalues λ1, λ2, ..., λn. We have that the spectral radius of A, defined as p(a), is equal to λk, such that p(a) = λk and λk is in the set of eigen values {λ1, λ2, ..., λn}. If p(a) > 1, what can be said about the limit as k approaches infinity of A^k * x for some arbitrary state vector x, x in R^n?  \n",
      ", given choices:  a) the limit will always go to infinity b) the limit will always go to 0 c) the limit will reach a steady state d) the limit will always be equal to the 1 vector e) the behavior of the limit depends on the state vector x?\n",

      "\n",
      "The correct answer is: **e) the behavior of the limit depends on the state vector x**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "When p(A) > 1, the eigenvalue λk with maximum modulus is greater than 1. This means that there exists a direction (or eigenvector) in which A stretches by a factor of |λk| > 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an arbitrary initial state vector x, we can write:\n",
      "\n",
      "A^k * x = λk^k * x + ... (higher-order terms)\n",
      "\n",
      "where ... denotes the contribution from other eigenvalues.\n",
      "\n",
      "If λk is not equal to 1 (the identity matrix), then A^k * x will grow exponentially with k, since |λk|^k > 1. However, this growth can be tempered if there are other eigenvalues with smaller moduli that contribute to the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, if there exists another eigenvalue λj with |λj| < |λk|, then A^k * x will eventually be dominated by the term λj^k * x as k grows large. In this case, the limit may converge to a steady state or even decay exponentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if all eigenvalues have modulus greater than 1 (i.e., p(A) = max{ |λ1|, ..., |λn| } > 1), then A^k * x will grow indefinitely as k approaches infinity. This is because there are no \"correcting\" eigenvalues with smaller moduli to counterbalance the growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the behavior of the limit depends on the specific state vector x and the eigenvalue structure of A.\n",

      "\n",
      "That's correct! The key insight here is that when p(A) > 1, there exists an eigenvalue λk with maximum modulus |λk| > 1. This means that A stretches in some direction by a factor of |λk|^k > 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact behavior of the limit A^k * x depends on the specific state vector x and the eigenvalue structure of A. If there are other eigenvalues with smaller moduli, they can counterbalance the growth of λk^k and lead to a steady state or decay.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if all eigenvalues have modulus greater than 1, then A^k * x will grow indefinitely as k approaches infinity. This is because there's no \"correction\" to balance out the growth.\n",

      "Exactly! The key takeaway here is that the behavior of the limit A^k * x is highly dependent on the specific state vector x and the eigenvalue structure of A. If there are other eigenvalues with smaller moduli, they can counterbalance the growth of λk^k and lead to a steady state or decay.\n",

    "We saw that on a smaller model, AutoGen proved to be the more capable framework, answering a question that the base LLM could not solve. Meanwhile, CrewAI provided a less-than-favorable environment for our smaller model. However, as we scaled up to the larger Gemini Pro, we can see that the CrewAI's ReAct input/ouput format proved to be helpful in solving our problem, even if the model ran into issues with tool usage. Yet AutoGen, which was successful with our smaller llama3, actually failed the question on the larger Gemini Pro. Thus, we can see that CrewAI's strict input/output format prevents smaller models from effectively utilizing its framework, but the structure allows larger models to answer questions they previously could not. Meanwhile, AutoGen's free-form structure allowed our smaller model to power an agent-based discussion, but gave our larger model too much freedom, which caused it to go \"off-track\" and find an incorrect solution."
